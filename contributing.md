To contribute, please send a pull request.

Guidelines:

* If you are contributing a new entry, please contribute both the heading and
  some supporting text.  This can include an explanation, expansion, citation
  of source, etc.
* Please check the existing entries to ensure that your proposed entry is not
  already present.
* Please include a header ID, so that the entry will have a stable id for
  linking. Depending on auto-generated header IDs means they might break if
  the header wording is changed.
* Please cross-link entries as appropriate (e.g., "see also _link_").
* Ideally, when contributing wholly new entries, send one per pull request.
  This is not a hard rule.
* Please test your changes locally with `jekyll serve`. See the README.

Thank you,

-Prodverbs.
